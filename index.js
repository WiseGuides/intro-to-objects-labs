/*
1. Create an object, me, that has your personal information including first name, last name, birthday. Output the object.

*/

/*
3. Create a new object, address, with your street, city, state, and zip. (Feel free to make these up too). Attach this object to your 'me' object, giving it a key of 'address'.
*/

/*
4. Attach 'them' to 'me', using a key of 'friends'.
*/

/*
5. Output the second persons in 'friends' (starting from the object, me).
*/

/*

*/

/*
7. Create a method for 'me', 'introduceFriends', that loops over each friend, outputting their first and last names.
*/

/*
8. Create a variable, 'myClone', that points to 'me'. Change the address for 'myClone'. What happened to the address of 'me'? Why did that happen?
